# Corpus of Parametric Linear Systems

This repository contains a corpus of 540 randomly generated parametric linear systems.

The corpus was originally found at http://www21.in.tum.de/~ballarin/data/c540/ but as of early 2018 the files seem to have been removed.

Ballarin, C., & Kauers, M. (2004). Solving parametric linear systems: an experiment with constraint algebraic programming. ACM SIGSAM Bulletin, 38(2), 33-46.

## Axiom
The Axiom folder contains the original Axiom files for each of the 540 examples.

## Maple
The Maple folder contains a python script `convert_to_maple.py` that will convert the Axiom examples into Maple code. The output of this script is the files corp-1.mpl to corp-540.mpl.
